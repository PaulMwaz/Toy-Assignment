CAR SPEED DETECTOR

This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines whether the driver is within the speed limit or if they should receive demerit points. It follows these rules:

    -If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints “Ok”.
    -For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the driver receives one demerit point.
    -If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, it prints: “License suspended”.

Example: 
         If the user inputs 80, the output will be:
	 Points:2
        
	 If the user inputs 140, the output will be:
	 Points:13
	 License suspended
